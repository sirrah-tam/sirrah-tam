# Hi hello there, I'm Mat with one T! 

I am the Web Accessibility Lead at [ITHAKA](https://www.ithaka.org) supporting our mission to expand access to knowledge and education around the world.

I have 6+ year experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, Git with working knowledge of WordPress and Laravel development. 

Prior to making the switch to accessibilty advocacy, I was a front-end web developer and have an academic background in Political Science and International Relations. My career started in the non-profit/association space working on special projects and quickly realized that I excelled most when using code to make things more beautiful and efficient. 

I'm interested in collaboration, open-source, and focusing on making more accessible web experiences for all users.
