# Hi hello there, I'm Mat with one T! 

I am an accessibility consultant, currently working at [Level Access](https://www.levelaccess.com/) to help facilitate the accessibility journey of 15+ enterprise-level, large companies in the financial services industry.

I have 5+ year experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, Git with working knowledge of WordPress and Laravel development. 

Prior to making the switch to accessibilty consulting, I was a front-end web developer and have an academic background in Political Science and International Relations. My career started in the non-profit/association space working on special projects and quickly realized that I excelled most when using code to make things more beautiful and efficient. 

I'm interested in collaboration, open-source, and focusing on making more accessible web experiences for all users.
