# Hi hello there, I'm Mat Harris! 

I am a Web Accessibility Specialist and lead the accessibility strategy at [ITHAKA](https://www.ithaka.org) (JSTOR) supporting our mission to expand access to knowledge and education around the world.

I have 5 years experience in the accessibility world with over 7 years experience working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, and Git with working knowledge of WordPress and Laravel development. 

Prior to making the switch to accessibilty advocacy, I was a front-end web developer and have an academic background in Political Science and International Relations. My career started in the non-profit/association space working on special projects and quickly realized that I excelled most when using code to make things more beautiful, efficient, and accessible. 

I'm interested in collaboration, open-source, and focusing on making more accessible web experiences for all users.
